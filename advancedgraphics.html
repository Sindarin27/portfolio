        <p>
            During the Advanced Graphics course, I developed a raytracer from scratch together with another student. The
            program can render scenes with different materials such as glass and mirrors, applied to different shapes
            such as spheres and triangles, and using different raytracing algorithms such as the Whitted algorithm and
            the Monte Carlo algorithm (and a number of debug algorithms). Creating an algorithm to build and use a BVH
            to speed up the rendering process was also part of the assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            After implementing the basic functionality for the raytracer and BVH, we added additional features such as
            loading 3D models from OBJ files, supporting textured models, implementing glossy materials, and
            implementing the process of BVH building on the GPU.
        </p>
        <p>

            Finally, I implemented the paper "A null-scattering path integral formulation of light transport" by Miller
            *et al.* to render volumetric clouds in a scene, with the density of the cloud at a position determined
            using a custom cloud-generation algorithm developed by my teammate. In addition to the basic rendering of
            volumes using said technique, I also added support for next-event estimation within the volume.
        </p>
        <p>

            With the many types of materials, shapes, and algorithms that all need to be swapped out depending on scene
            and user settings, the project required not only the math typical of rendering: proper code organisation was
            almost as important, and a lot of our effort went into keeping the program expandable to keep it easy to add
            new shapes, materials, and algorithms.
