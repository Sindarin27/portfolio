            When creating my character for an outdoor roleplaying event, I decided I wanted to play an anarchist running
            a pirate radio. The event already had participants playing music on their phones to simulate radio or record
            players, and I saw an opportunity to introduce live radio broadcasts.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the event being in the middle of a forest, connection was a major issue. I solved this using the
            hotspot functionality on a Raspberry Pi, creating a small local network. The range of this network was large
            enough to cover the most relevant playing area; outdoor conditions are good for connections, as is the lack
            of interference in such a location. The network can easily be expanded in the future using a more powerful
            WiFi router or a network of mobile phone hotspots if necessary.

            Also installed on the Raspberry Pi is the AzuraCast software, a flexible framework for running online radio.
            In my case, I used it to run two radio channels on separate web pages: one for my own radio channel and one
            to facilitate the event's own channel.
        </p>

            When the Raspberry Pi is connected to the larger internet, traffic is routed from an address on my own
            website to the radio's web pages. When the device is offline, it runs its own DNS to point users to the same
            website. I initially considered simply using the IP address of the Raspberry Pi to connect to the radio, but
            this made browsers warn or even prevent users from using HTTPS when connected. This approach allows the
            device to stay offline for 90 days and still maintain a trusted certificate — more than long enough for my
            use case.

            To add an additional "puzzle element" to the radio, I recently added a third, 'secret' radio channel filled
            with secret messages. Scattered throughout my character's belongings are calculations, blueprints, and
            wiring diagrams for running a radio channel encrypted within her normal radio channel. Specifically, some of
            the sounds are manipulated to cancel out when the sound waves are combined with that of another radio
            frequency, revealing a secret third channel. Do not ask me about the physical accuracy of this; I'm not a
            physicist and all of this is for a game of make-believe. Much more my thing is actually implementing this:
            AzuraCast provides the option to add your own JavaScript code to its web pages. By finding out which events
            AzuraCast uses to start and stop a stream and communicating this information across tabs, I was able to
            detect when a user started playing 2 different radio channels at the same time. When this happens, my code
            replaces the audio source of one of the streams with the audio source of the secret stream. To provide the
            person discovering this secret with visual feedback as well, the background and title of the page change to
            represent the glitched nature of the secret radio stream.
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, this project was a lot of fun to work on, and invited many other players to contribute to the
            radio in their own way — which is the ultimate reward for a project like this.
