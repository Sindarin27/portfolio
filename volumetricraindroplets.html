        <h1 class="page_title">Applying Volumetric Sampling Methods to the Rendering of Rain
            Droplets (2024)</h1>

        <p>
            I developed a new technique for rendering physically accurate rain streaks for my master thesis and
            implemented it in the rendering software <a href="https://www.pbrt.org/">PBRT-4</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inspired by volumetric rendering techniques such as the one implemented in <a
                href="advancedgraphics.html">one of my previous projects</a>, I started researching the possibilities of
            using the same techniques to render rain streaks from a procedurally generated volume. In addition to
            researching more about existing volumetric rendering techniques, this included research into the physical
            properties of rain and the challenges these would present. I also implemented a ground truth algorithm to
            use for comparison with the method I was to develop.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final implementation and math went smoothly and presented further optimisation possibilities by
            replacing the smallest rain drops with a uniform fog throughout the scene. The extra predictability
            presented by volume sampling allows a lot of noise reduction compared to the ground truth method, and allows
            the algorithm to run on the GPU. The method is still impractically slow for real-time rendering and requires
            further research to be fully physically accurate, but is currently one of the first approaches to rain
            rendering in the raytracing scene.
